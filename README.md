# Craigslist Scraper App

The Craigslist Scraper App scrapes data off the Craigslist.org/. 
### About Craigslist.org: 
It is an Ad-Hosting website, which is really very useful, but pretty cluttered!

So we came up with an idea of scraping the data from it and presenting it in visually pleasing way :-)
For that purpose I have used **MaterializeUI.**

**The data is scraped using BeautifulSoup4 and then rendered back using Django backend.**

Enter the thing you want to search and it presents it in beautiful way.
## To run the project on local system:

Follow the below steps:

1.) Make a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). It keeps things organised and CLEAN. </br>
</br>
2.) Install the requirements!
### `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.) Run 
### `python manage.py runserver`

### You are Done!
